Guide to A Dynamin-Related protein required for Nuclear Remodeling in Tetrahymen

tetrahymen:-A free-living Genus, Ciliated helps in microtubule reaction, common in fresh water ponds, easy reproducable.

germlin cells:-the cells required for reproduction.

mac and min:- tetrahymens have 2 nuclie, the mac(macronucleus) is the larger on it does not contain germline cells, regulates metabolic processes. while, min(micronucleus) is relatively far smaller, performs reproductive functions. Tetrahyman has both of them.

NPC:- nuclear pore complexes, basically the compounds found at the nuclear pores.

Tagging proteins:-
GFP:-Green Fluorescent Protein. GFP traditionally refers to the protein first isolated from the jellyfish Aequorea victoria.
HA:-Human influenza hemagglutinin.The HA tag is not suitable for detection or purification of proteins from apoptotic cells

ΔDRP:- cells which do not have DRP

Summary

We use tagging protiens to tag drp6 and some NPC called Nup3.
result was drp6 was patchly distributed and Nup3 was evenly distributed

Then created ΔDRP cells, and found that it did not affect the distribution of Nup3(same tag was used)
